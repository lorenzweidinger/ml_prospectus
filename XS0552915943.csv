828;21    RISK FACTORS  An investment in the notes involves risks;Nothing
829;You should consider carefully the risks described below and elsewhere in this listing memorandum (including the Appendix and documents incorporated by reference) before you decide to purchase the notes;Nothing
830;These risks are not the only ones facing us;Nothing
831;Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations;Nothing
832;Any of the following risks and other risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations;Nothing
833;In such case, you may lose all or part of your original investment;Nothing
834;Risks Relating to the Notes  We have, and will continue to have, substantial debt and significant interest payment requirements which could adversely affect our financial condition and therefore make it more difficult for Bombardier to fulfill its obligations under the notes;Nothing
835;We currently have, and will continue to have, a substantial amount of debt and significant interest payment requirements;Nothing
836;As at July 31, 2010, as adjusted after giving effect to the completion of this offering and the application of the proceeds therefrom as described under ?Use of Proceeds,? we would have had $4;Nothing
837;"55 billion of consolidated total debt (calculated using the currency exchange rate as at July 30, 2010; see ?Capitalization,? including footnote 1 in such section)";Nothing
838;"Our level of indebtedness could have significant consequences, including the following:  ? make it more difficult for Bombardier to satisfy its obligations with respect to the notes and its other indebtedness;  ? increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;  ? require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to making interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund capital expenditures, working capital, acquisitions, new business initiatives and other general corporate purposes;  ? limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate;  ? place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or greater financial resources; and  ? limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds on commercially reasonable terms, if at all";Nothing
839;Our letter of credit issuance facilities (which we refer to as ?L/C Facilities?) described under the heading ?Description of Other Indebtedness and Letter of Credit Facilities?L/C Facilities? in this listing memorandum, Bombardier?s senior unsecured revolving credit facility and the respective indentures governing its existing outstanding notes permit us to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future;Nothing
840;If we incur additional debt, the risks we now face as a result of our leverage could intensify;Nothing
841;For more information regarding our long-term debt, see ?Description of Other Indebtedness and Letter of Credit Facilities? elsewhere in this listing memorandum, as well as notes 11 and 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2010 included elsewhere in this listing memorandum;Nothing
842;22    The covenants in the L/C Facilities, Bombardier?s senior unsecured revolving credit facility and its outstanding debt instruments impose operating and financial restrictions on it;Nothing
843;If we default under these covenants or governing documents, we may not be able to make payments on the notes;Nothing
844;"The L/C Facilities, Bombardier?s senior unsecured revolving credit facility and the respective indentures governing its existing outstanding notes, and the indenture governing the notes, contain covenants that, among other things, restrict Bombardier?s ability, and in some cases the ability of its subsidiaries, to:  ? incur additional debt and provide guarantees;  ? create or permit certain liens;  ? use the proceeds from the sale of assets and subsidiary stock;  ? pay dividends and make certain other restricted payments;  ? create or permit restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments;  ? engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and  ? enter into certain consolidations, mergers or transfers of all or substantially all of our assets";Nothing
845;These restrictions could impair our ability to finance our future operational or capital needs, or to engage in other business activities that may be in our interest;Nothing
846;Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control;Nothing
847;A breach of any of these agreements or our inability to comply with these covenants could, if not cured or waived, result in an acceleration of our debt or a cross-default under certain of our debt, and could permit certain of our lenders or issuing banks under the L/C Facilities to request immediate cash collateralization;Nothing
848;If our indebtedness is accelerated, or we are subject to significant collateralization calls, we may not be able to service our indebtedness, including making interest and principal payments on the notes offered hereby, or borrow sufficient funds to refinance our indebtedness;Nothing
849;In addition, if we incur additional debt in the future, we may be subject to additional covenants, which may be more restrictive than those that we are subject to now;Nothing
850;Bombardier has a $500;Nothing
851;0 million two-year unsecured revolving credit facility which is available for cash drawings for its general working capital needs which is undrawn since its inception;Nothing
852;The notes are unsecured and will be subordinated to Bombardier?s secured indebtedness;Nothing
853;The notes are unsecured and therefore are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness that Bombardier has incurred, or may in the future incur, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness;Nothing
854;The notes are therefore effectively subordinated to certain obligations under the L/C Facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such obligations, including approximately 3404;Nothing
855;0 million of invested collateral under the L/C Facility for our BT group (the ?BT L/C Facility?) and approximately $121;Nothing
856;2 million of invested collateral under the L/C Facility for Bombardier and our BA group (the ?BI L/C Facility?);Nothing
857;In the event of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the assets that serve as collateral for our secured indebtedness will be available to satisfy the obligations under the secured indebtedness before any payments are made on the notes;Nothing
858;Holders of the notes will participate ratably in Bombardier?s remaining assets with all holders of Bombardier?s unsecured indebtedness that is deemed to rank equally with the notes, and potentially with all other general creditors (including trade creditors), based upon the respective amounts owed to each holder;Nothing
859;In any of the foregoing events, there may be insufficient assets to pay amounts due on the notes;Nothing
860;As a result,  23    holders of the notes may receive less from Bombardier?s assets, ratably, than holders of Bombardier?s secured indebtedness;Nothing
861;In addition, the L/C Facilities, our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and the respective indentures governing our existing outstanding notes and the notes offered hereby permit us to incur substantial additional secured indebtedness in the future;Nothing
862;See ?Description of Other Indebtedness and Letter of Credit Facilities? and ?Description of the Notes? elsewhere in this listing memorandum;Nothing
863;Your right to receive payments on the notes is structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of Bombardier?s subsidiaries, including in respect of the BT L/C Facility;Nothing
864;We currently conduct a significant portion of our operations through our subsidiaries and our subsidiaries have significant liabilities;Nothing
865;In addition, we may conduct additional operations through our subsidiaries in the future and, accordingly, our subsidiaries? liabilities may increase;Nothing
866;Our cash flow and our ability to service our debt, including the notes, therefore, partially depends upon the earnings of our subsidiaries, and we depend on the distribution of earnings, loans or other payments by those subsidiaries to us;Nothing
867;Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities, and the notes are not guaranteed by our subsidiaries;Nothing
868;In the absence of a subsidiary guarantee, our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay any amounts due on the notes or, subject to existing or future contractual obligations between us and our subsidiaries, to provide us with funds for our payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or other payments;Nothing
869;In addition, any payment of dividends, distributions, loans or advances by our subsidiaries to us may be subject to statutory restrictions, taxes on distributions and contractual restrictions, such as the financial covenants applicable to BT?s subsidiaries under the BT L/C Facility, which include a covenant to maintain minimum liquidity of 3600;Nothing
870;0 million in BT as at each quarter-end, as well as a minimum equity and a maximum leverage ratio;Nothing
871;See also note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2010 included elsewhere in this listing memorandum;Nothing
872;Payments to us by our subsidiaries will also be contingent upon our subsidiaries? earnings and business considerations;Nothing
873;See also the risk factors titled, ??Bombardier depends to a certain extent on its subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its debt service obligations, including payments on the notes? and ?Risks Relating to our Business?Financing Risk?Restrictive debt covenants? below;Nothing
874;As a result, the notes are effectively structurally subordinated to all of the debt and other liabilities of Bombardier?s subsidiaries, including trade creditors and including in respect of the BT L/C Facility and letter of credit facilities of BT?s subsidiaries;Nothing
875;Our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon liquidation or reorganization, and, as a result, the right of the holders of the notes to participate in those assets, will be effectively subordinated to the claims of the respective subsidiary?s creditors, including trade creditors;Nothing
876;The indenture governing the notes does not restrict us or our subsidiaries from incurring additional liabilities, except in the limited circumstances described under ?Description of the Notes;Nothing
877;? In addition, even if we were a creditor of any of our subsidiaries, our rights as a creditor would be subordinated in right of payment to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries, including approximately 3404;Nothing
878;0 million of invested collateral under the BT L/C Facility, senior to indebtedness held by us;Nothing
879;Bombardier depends to a certain extent on its subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its debt service obligations, including payments on the notes;Nothing
880;A certain portion of Bombardier?s assets are the capital stock of its subsidiaries and Bombardier conducts an important portion of its business through its subsidiaries;Nothing
881;Consequently, Bombardier?s cash flow and ability to service its debt obligations, including in respect of the notes offered hereby, are dependent to a certain extent upon the earnings of its  24    subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to Bombardier, or upon loans, advances or other payments made by these entities to Bombardier;Nothing
882;The ability of these entities to pay dividends or make other loans, advances or payments to Bombardier will depend upon their operating results and will be subject to applicable laws and contractual restrictions contained in the instruments governing their debt including, for example, the financial covenants applicable to BT?s subsidiaries under the BT L/C Facility, which include a covenant to maintain minimum liquidity of 3600;Nothing
883;0 million in BT as at each calendar quarter-end, as well as a minimum equity and a maximum leverage ratio;Nothing
884;The ability of Bombardier?s subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to allow Bombardier to make scheduled payments on Bombardier?s debt obligations, including the notes offered hereby, will depend on their future financial performance, which will be affected by a range of economic, competitive and business factors, including those discussed above, many of which are outside of the control of Bombardier or its subsidiaries;Nothing
885;The cash flow and earnings of Bombardier?s operating subsidiaries and the amount that they are able to distribute to Bombardier as dividends or otherwise may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy Bombardier?s debt obligations, including payments on the notes;Nothing
886;Accordingly, Bombardier may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring its debt, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital;Nothing
887;We cannot assure you that any such alternatives would be possible, that any assets could be sold, or, if sold, of the timing of the sales and the amount of proceeds realized from those sales, that additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms, if at all, or that additional financing would be permitted under the terms of the indenture governing the notes or of our various debt instruments then in effect;Nothing
888;Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms, would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as on our ability to satisfy our obligations on the notes offered hereby;Nothing
889;We may need to refinance certain of our indebtedness or renew our L/C Facilities;Nothing
890;Our inability to do so on favourable terms, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on us;Nothing
891;We may need to refinance certain of our existing debt instruments at their term or renew our L/C Facilities;Nothing
892;A portion of such debt instruments and L/C Facilities have a maturity date or terminate prior to the maturity date of the notes;Nothing
893;Our ability to obtain additional financing to repay our existing debt at maturity or renew our L/C Facilities will depend upon a number of factors, including prevailing market conditions and our operating performance;Nothing
894;The tightening of credit availability and the well-publicized challenges affecting global capital markets could also limit our ability to refinance our existing maturities or renew our L/C Facilities;Nothing
895;There can be no assurance that any such financing will be available to us on favourable terms or at all;Nothing
896;A decline in our credit ratings or changes in the financial and credit markets may adversely affect the market prices of the notes;Nothing
897;"The future market prices of the notes will be affected by a number of factors, including the following, among others:  ? our ratings with major credit rating agencies;  ? the prevailing interest rates being paid by companies similar to us; and  ? the overall condition of the financial and credit markets";Nothing
898;The financial and credit markets have recently experienced significant turmoil;Nothing
899;Additionally, the condition of the financial and credit markets and prevailing interest rates have  25    fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future;Nothing
900;Further disruptions in the financial and credit markets and future fluctuations in these markets and prevailing interest rates may have an adverse effect on the prices of the notes;Nothing
901;Additionally, the credit ratings assigned to us and the notes are limited in scope, and do not address all material risks relating to an investment in the notes, but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time the rating is issued;Nothing
902;An explanation of the significance of such rating may be obtained from such rating agency;Nothing
903;Credit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for companies that they follow, including us;Nothing
904;There can be no assurance that the credit ratings on us or the notes will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the applicable rating agencies, if, in such rating agency?s judgment, circumstances so warrant;Nothing
905;Agency credit ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security;Nothing
906;Each agency?s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency?s rating;Nothing
907;Actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, may affect the market value of the notes and increase our borrowing costs;Nothing
908;Bombardier may not be able to finance an offer to purchase the notes required by the indenture following a change of control because it may not have sufficient funds at the time of the change of control, or our L/C Facilities or our senior unsecured revolving credit facility (or other future agreements) may not permit the repurchases;Nothing
909;If Bombardier experiences a change of control, as that term is defined under ?Description of the Notes?Certain Definitions? (as well as under the respective indentures governing certain of our existing outstanding notes), Bombardier may be required to make an offer to repurchase all of your notes or its outstanding notes prior to maturity;Nothing
910;Bombardier cannot assure you that it will have sufficient funds or be able to arrange for additional financing to repurchase any of its debt securities, including the notes, following such a change of control;Nothing
911;There is no sinking fund with respect to the notes;Nothing
912;Certain changes of control would also constitute an event of termination under our L/C Facilities and under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which could result in the acceleration and cancellation of our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and the cancellation of the L/C Facilities and the requirement to post cash collateralization in respect of the face amount of all outstanding letters of credit issued thereunder;Nothing
913;Any future credit agreement or other agreements relating to our senior indebtedness to which we become a party may contain similar provisions;Nothing
914;Bombardier?s failure to purchase the notes tendered pursuant to a repurchase offer made in the event of a change of control would, pursuant to the indenture governing the notes offered hereby (and pursuant to the indentures governing certain of Bombardier?s existing outstanding notes), constitute an event of default;Nothing
915;Any such event of default could, in turn, constitute an event of default under future senior indebtedness, any of which may cause the related debt to be accelerated after the expiry of any applicable notice or grace periods;Nothing
916;If debt were to be accelerated, Bombardier may not have sufficient funds to repurchase the notes and repay the debt;Nothing
917;Canadian bankruptcy and insolvency laws may impair the trustee?s ability to enforce remedies under the notes;Nothing
918;Bombardier is organized under the laws of Canada and a portion of its assets are located in Canada;Nothing
919;The rights of the trustee who represents the holders of the notes to enforce remedies could be delayed by the restructuring provisions of applicable Canadian federal bankruptcy, insolvency and other restructuring legislation if the benefit of such legislation is sought with respect to Bombardier;Nothing
920;For example, both the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada) and the Companies? Creditors Arrangement Act (Canada) contain provisions enabling  26    an insolvent person to obtain a stay of proceedings against its creditors and to file a proposal or plan of compromise or arrangement to be voted on by the various classes of its affected creditors;Nothing
921;A restructuring proposal, compromise or arrangement if accepted by the requisite majorities of each affected class of creditors, and if approved by the relevant Canadian court, would be binding on all creditors within each affected class, including those creditors that did not vote to accept the proposal, compromise or arrangement;Nothing
922;Moreover, this legislation, in certain instances, permits the insolvent debtor to retain possession and administration of its property, subject to court oversight, even though it may be in default under the applicable debt instrument, during the period that the stay against proceedings remains in place;Nothing
923;The powers of the court under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada) and particularly under the Companies? Creditors Arrangement Act (Canada) have been interpreted and exercised broadly so as to protect a restructuring entity from actions taken by creditors and other parties;Nothing
924;Accordingly, we cannot predict whether payments under the notes would be made during any proceedings in bankruptcy, insolvency or other restructuring, whether or when the trustee could exercise its rights under the indenture governing the notes or whether and to what extent holders of the notes would be compensated for any delays in payment, if any, of principal, interest and costs, including the fees and disbursements of the trustee;Nothing
925;Investors in the notes located outside of Canada may have difficulties enforcing civil liabilities;Nothing
926;Bombardier is incorporated under the laws of Canada;Nothing
927;Moreover, the majority of our directors, controlling persons and officers, as well as certain of the experts named in this listing memorandum, are residents of Canada or other jurisdictions outside the United States, and all or a substantial portion of their assets and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the United States;Nothing
928;We will agree, in accordance with the terms of the indenture under which the notes will be issued, to accept service of process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the indenture or the notes brought in any federal or state court located in New York City by an agent designated for such purpose, and to submit to the jurisdiction of such courts in connection with such suits, actions or proceedings;Nothing
929;Nevertheless, it may be difficult for holders of the notes to effect service of process within the United States upon directors, officers and experts who are not residents of the United States or to enforce against Bombardier or them in the United States upon judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon civil liability under U;Nothing
930;S;Nothing

940;?  There is no public market for the notes and an active trading market may not develop for the notes which may reduce their market price;Nothing
941;There is currently no established trading market for the notes;Nothing
942;Application has been made for the notes to be listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, but no assurance can be given that the notes will remain admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market and listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange;Nothing
943;We have been advised by the initial purchasers that they presently intend to make a market in the notes, but they are under no obligation to do so, and any such market-making may be discontinued at any time without notice, at the sole discretion of the initial purchasers;Nothing
944;Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the prices or liquidity of, or trading markets for,  27    the notes;Nothing
945;The liquidity of any market for the notes will depend upon the number of holders of the notes, the interest of securities dealers in making a market in the notes, prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities and other factors, including general economic conditions, our business, financial condition and results of operations;Nothing
946;The absence of an active market for the notes could adversely affect the market price and liquidity of the notes;Nothing
947;In addition, the market for non-investment grade debt has historically been subject to disruptions that caused volatility in prices;Nothing
948;It is possible that the market for the notes will be subject to disruptions;Nothing
949;Any such disruptions may have a negative effect on your ability to sell the notes regardless of our prospects and financial performance;Nothing
950;Resale of the notes is restricted, which may impact your ability to sell the notes;Nothing
951;We are relying upon an exemption from the registration requirement of the Securities Act and other applicable securities laws to offer and sell the notes;Nothing

954;persons in offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act;Nothing
955;The notes are subject to restrictions on transfer as described under ?Notice to Investors;Nothing
956;? We have no obligation, and we do not intend, to register the notes (in an exchange offer or otherwise) under the Securities Act;Nothing
957;Further, the notes may not be sold or transferred directly or indirectly in Canada except in accordance with applicable securities laws of any province or territory of Canada;Nothing
958;It is your obligation to ensure that your offers and sales of the notes within the United States, Canada or other jurisdictions comply with the transfer restrictions contained in this listing memorandum, in the indenture governing the notes and in the applicable laws of those jurisdictions;Nothing
959;The notes will be held in book-entry form and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the relevant clearing system to exercise any rights and remedies;Nothing
960;The notes will be issued in fully registered form;Nothing
961;The notes will be deposited, on the closing date, with, or on behalf of, a common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary;Nothing
962;Ownership of beneficial interests in the global notes (the ?Book-Entry Interests?) will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold interests through such participants;Nothing
963;Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants;Nothing
964;Owners of beneficial interests in the global notes will not be entitled to receive definitive notes in registered form, except under the limited circumstances described in ?Description of the Notes?Book-Entry, Delivery and Form;Nothing
965;? So long as the notes are held in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the owners or ?holders? of global notes;Nothing
966;The common depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream, or their respective nominees, as applicable, will be considered the sole holders of global notes;Nothing
967;Payments of any amounts owing in respect of the global notes (including principal, premium, interest and additional amounts, if any) will be made by Bombardier to the paying agent;Nothing
968;The paying agent will, in turn, make such payments to the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and/or Clearstream;Nothing
969;The common depositary or its nominee will in turn distribute such payments to participants in accordance with its procedures;Nothing
970;After payment to the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and/or Clearstream, we will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the holders of Book-Entry Interests;Nothing
971;Accordingly, if you hold a Book-Entry Interest, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and if you are not a participant in Euroclear or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you hold your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of notes under the indenture governing the notes;Nothing
972;28    Unlike the holders of the notes themselves, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not have the direct right to act upon Bombardier?s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the notes;Nothing
973;Instead, if you hold a Book-Entry Interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable;Nothing
974;The procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable you to vote on a timely basis;Nothing
975;Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the indenture governing the notes, unless and until definitive registered notes are issued in respect of all Book-Entry Interests, if you hold a Book- Entry Interest, you will be restricted to acting through Euroclear or Clearstream;Nothing
976;The procedures to be implemented through Euroclear or Clearstream may not be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the notes;Nothing
977;Risks Relating to Our Business  We operate in industry segments that have a variety of risk factors and uncertainties;Nothing
978;The risks and uncertainties described below are risks that could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, but are not necessarily the only risks we face;Nothing
979;Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently believe to be immaterial, may also adversely affect our business;Nothing
980;To the extent possible, we apply risk assessment;Nothing
981;Where practicable, we apply risk management and mitigation practices to reduce the nature and extent of our exposure to these risks to an acceptable level;Nothing
982;General economic risk  General economic risk refers to potential loss due to unfavourable economic conditions, such as a continued macroeconomic downturn in key markets, could result in a lower order intake, order cancellation or deferral, downward pressure on selling prices, increased inventory levels, curtailment of production activities, termination of employees, and adverse impacts on our customers and suppliers;Nothing
983;The impacts of general economic risk on our business is discussed in the respective business environment sections of Overview, BA and BT of our ?Management?s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations? Fiscal year ended January 31, 2010,? included elsewhere in this listing memorandum;Nothing
984;Business environment risk  Business environment risk is the potential loss due to external risk factors, more specifically the financial condition of the airline industry and major rail operators, government policies related to import and export restrictions, changing priorities and possible spending cuts by government agencies, government support to export sales, world trade policies, competition from other businesses, as well as scope clauses in pilot union agreements restricting the operation of smaller jetliners by major airlines or by their regional affiliates;Nothing
985;In addition, acts of terrorism, global health risks and political instability, or the outbreak of war or continued hostilities in certain regions of the world, could result in lower orders or the rescheduling or cancellation of part of the existing order backlog for some of our products;Nothing
986;Airline industry financial condition  The airline industry?s financial condition and viability, as well as the ability of airlines to secure financing, influence the demand for BA?s commercial aircraft;Nothing
987;The nature of the airline industry makes it difficult to predict the timing of the impact of economic downturns or recoveries on the industry and cycles may be longer than expected;Nothing
988;Continued cost and yield pressure in the airline industry puts pressure on the selling price of BA?s products;Nothing
989;An  29    increased supply of used aircraft as companies downsize or discontinue operations also adds downward pressure on selling price of new and used business and commercial aircraft;Nothing
990;We are faced with the challenge of finding ways to reduce costs and improve productivity to sustain a favourable market position at acceptable profit margins;Nothing
991;The loss of any major commercial airline as a customer or the termination of a contract could significantly reduce our revenues and profitability;Nothing
992;Rail industry financial condition  World economic and financial conditions may have a negative impact on some rail operators, particularly in the freight segment;Nothing
993;Unfavourable economic conditions may result in projects being reduced in size, postponed or even cancelled;Nothing
994;Such actions by rail operators or governments would negatively impact BT?s order intake and revenues and put pressure on its cost structure;Nothing
995;Operational risk  Operational risk is the potential loss due to risks related to developing new products and services, actions of business partners, product performance warranty and casualty claim losses, regulatory and legal risks, environmental, health and safety risks, as well as dependence on customers, suppliers and human resources;Nothing
996;In addition, large and complex projects are common in our businesses, most often structured as fixed-price contracts;Nothing
997;We are also subject to risks related to problems with production and project execution, supply management, reliance on information systems, as well as the successful integration of new acquisitions;Nothing
998;Developing new products and services  The principal markets in which we operate experience change due to the introduction of new technologies;Nothing
999;To meet our customers? needs, we must continuously design new products, update existing products and services, and invest and develop new technologies, which may require significant capital investments;Nothing
1000;Introducing new products requires a significant commitment to research and development, which may or may not be successful;Nothing
1001;Our sales may be impacted if we invest in products that are not accepted in the marketplace, if customer demand or preferences change, if the products are not approved by regulatory authorities or if the products are not brought to market in a timely manner or become obsolete;Nothing
1002;We are subject to stringent certification and approval requirements, which vary by country and can delay the certification of our products;Nothing
1003;Non-compliance with current or future regulatory requirements imposed by Transport Canada, the Federal Aviation Administration, the European Aviation Safety Agency, the Transport Safety Institute and national rail regulatory bodies or other regulatory authorities, could result in the service interruption of our products;Nothing
1004;Fixed-price commitments and project execution  We have historically offered, and will continue to offer, virtually all of our products on fixed-price contracts, rather than contracts under which payment is determined solely on a time-and-material basis;Nothing
1005;Generally, we may not terminate these contracts unilaterally;Nothing
1006;We are exposed to risks associated with these contracts, including unexpected technological problems, difficulties with our partners and subcontractors and logistical difficulties that could lead to cost overruns and late delivery penalties;Nothing
1007;In addition, long-term contract revenues and costs are based, in part, on estimates that are subject to a number of assumptions, such as forecasted costs of materials, inflation rates, foreign exchange rates, labour productivity, employment levels and salaries, and are influenced by the nature and  30    complexity of the work to be performed, the impact of change orders and the impact of delayed delivery;Nothing
1008;Business partners  In some of the projects carried out through consortia or other partnership vehicles in BT, all partners are jointly and severally liable to the customer;Nothing
1009;The success of these partnerships is dependent on satisfactory performance by our business partners and us;Nothing
1010;Failure of the business partners to fulfill their contractual obligations could subject us to additional financial and performance obligations that could result in increased costs, unforeseen delays, losses or write-down of assets;Nothing
1011;In addition, a partner withdrawing from a consortium during the bid phase, in particular in the BT systems business, may result in the loss of potential order intake;Nothing
1012;Product performance warranty and casualty claim losses  The products that we manufacture are highly complex and sophisticated and may contain defects that are difficult to detect and correct;Nothing
1013;Our products are subject to stringent certification or approval requirements, as well as detailed specifications listed in the individual contracts with customers;Nothing
1014;Defects may be found in our products after they are delivered to the customer;Nothing
1015;If discovered, we may not be able to correct defects in a timely manner, or at all;Nothing
1016;The occurrence of defects and failures in our products could result in warranty claims, negatively affect our reputation and profitability and result in the loss of customers;Nothing
1017;Correcting such defects could require significant capital investment;Nothing
1018;In addition, due to the nature of our business, we may be subject to liability claims arising from accidents or disasters involving our products, or products for which we have provided services, including claims for serious personal injuries or death, and these accidents may include accidents caused by climatic factors, or by pilot or driver error;Nothing
1019;We cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover one or more substantial claims;Nothing
1020;Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain insurance coverage at acceptable levels and cost in the future;Nothing
1021;Regulatory and legal risks  We are subject to numerous risks relating to new regulations or legal proceedings to which we are currently a party or that could develop in the future;Nothing
1022;We become party to lawsuits in the ordinary course of our business, including those involving allegations of late deliveries of goods or services, product liability, product defects, quality problems and intellectual property infringement;Nothing
1023;We may incur losses relating to litigation beyond the limits or outside the coverage of our insurance, and our provisions for litigation-related losses may not be sufficient to cover the ultimate loss or expenditure;Nothing
1024;"Environmental risks  Our products, as well as our manufacturing and service activities, are subject to environmental laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, governing among other things: product performance or content; air and water emissions; the use, disposal, storage, transportation, labelling and release of hazardous substances; human health risks arising from the exposure to hazardous or toxic materials; and the remediation of soil and groundwater contamination on or under our properties (whether or not caused by us), or on or under other properties and caused by our current or past operations";Nothing
1025;Environmental regulatory requirements, or enforcements thereof, may become more stringent in the future, and we may incur additional costs to be compliant with such future requirements or enforcements;Nothing
1026;In addition, we may have contractual or other liabilities for  31    environmental matters relating to businesses, products or properties that we have in the past closed, sold or otherwise disposed of, or that we close, sell or dispose of in the future;Nothing
1027;Customers  For certain of our products, we depend on a limited number of customers and we believe that we will continue to depend on a limited number of customers;Nothing
1028;Consequently, the loss of such customers could result in fewer sales or a lower market share;Nothing
1029;Since the majority of BT?s customers are public companies or operate under public contracts, BT?s order intake is also dependent on public budgets and spending policies;Nothing
1030;Suppliers  Our manufacturing operations are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for the delivery of raw materials (aluminum, advanced aluminum alloy, titanium) and services and major systems(engines, wings, nacelles and fuselages) in BA, and raw materials (steel, aluminum) and major systems (brakes, doors, heating, ventilation and air conditioning) in BT;Nothing
1031;A failure to meet performance specifications, quality standards, and delivery schedules by one or more suppliers could adversely affect our ability to meet our commitments to customers;Nothing
1032;Some of these suppliers participate in the development of products such as aircraft or rolling stock platforms;Nothing
1033;They also participate in the subsequent delivery of materials and major components and own some of the intellectual property on the key components they develop;Nothing
1034;Our contracts with these suppliers are therefore on a long-term basis;Nothing
1035;The replacement of suppliers could be costly and take a significant amount of time;Nothing
1036;Human resources (including collective agreements)  Human resources risk would arise if we were unable to recruit, retain, and motivate highly skilled employees, including those involved in the research and development activities that are essential to our success;Nothing
1037;In addition, we are party to several collective agreements that are due to expire at various times in the future;Nothing
1038;If we are unable to renew these collective agreements on similar terms as they become subject to renegotiation from time to time, this could result in work stoppages or other labour disturbances and/or increased costs of labour;Nothing
1039;Financing risk  Financing risk is the risk of potential loss related to liquidity and access to capital markets, restrictive debt covenants, financing support provided for the benefit of certain customers, as well as government support;Nothing
1040;Liquidity and access to capital markets  We require continued access to capital markets to support our activities;Nothing
1041;To satisfy our financing needs, we rely on cash resources, debt and cash flow generated from operations;Nothing
1042;A decline in credit ratings, a significant reduction in the surety or financing market global capacity, significant changes in market interest rates or general economic conditions, or an adverse perception in capital markets of our financial condition or prospects, could all significantly impede our ability to access capital markets;Nothing
1043;Credit ratings may be impacted by many external factors beyond our control and, accordingly, no assurance can be given that our credit ratings may not be reduced in the future;Nothing
1044;"32    Restrictive debt covenants  Our L/C Facilities, our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and the indentures governing certain of our notes contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to:  ? incur additional debt and provide guarantees;  ? repay subordinated debt;  ? create or permit certain liens;  ? use the proceeds from the sale of assets and subsidiary stock;  ? pay dividends and make certain other disbursements;  ? allow our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments;  ? engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and  ? enter into certain consolidations, mergers or transfers of all or certain assets";Nothing
1045;These restrictions could impair our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs, or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest;Nothing
1046;We are subject to various financial covenants under our L/C Facilities and our revolving credit facility, which must be met on a quarterly basis;Nothing
1047;See ?Description of Other Indebtedness and Letter of Credit Facilities;Nothing
1048;?  Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control;Nothing
1049;A breach of any of these agreements or our inability to comply with these covenants could also result in a default under these facilities, which would permit our banks to request the immediate cash collateralization of all outstanding letters of credit, and our bondholders and other lenders to declare amounts owed to them to be immediately payable;Nothing
1050;If repayment of our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our indebtedness or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it;Nothing
1051;Financing support provided for the benefit of certain customers  From time to time, we provide aircraft financing support to customers;Nothing
1052;We may also provide interim financing while a permanent financing solution is being arranged, which includes loans made to customers and, on a limited basis, the leasing of aircraft to customers;Nothing
1053;We face the risk that certain customers may not be able to obtain permanent financing;Nothing
1054;We may also provide, directly or indirectly, credit and residual value guarantees to airlines to support financing for airlines or to support financings by certain SPEs created solely i) to purchase our commercial aircraft and to lease those aircraft to airlines, and ii) to purchase financial assets related to commercial aircraft manufactured by BA;Nothing
1055;Under these arrangements, we are obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event that the original debtor or lessee does not make the lease or loan payments, or if the market or resale value of the aircraft is below the guaranteed residual value amount at an agreed-upon date;Nothing
1056;A substantial portion of these guarantees has been extended to support original debtors or lessees with less than investment grade credit;Nothing
1057;Government support  From time to time, we receive various types of financial government support;Nothing
1058;Some of these financial support programs require that we pay amounts to the government at the time of delivery of products, contingent on achievement of an agreed-upon minimum level of related product sales;Nothing
1059;The level of government support reflects government policy and depends on fiscal spending levels and other political and economic factors;Nothing
1060;We cannot predict  33    if future government-sponsored support will be available;Nothing
1061;The loss or any substantial reduction in the availability of government support could negatively impact our liquidity assumptions regarding the development of aircraft or new rail products and services;Nothing
1062;In addition, any future government support received by our competitors could have a negative impact on our competitiveness, sales and market share;Nothing
1063;Market risk  Market risk is the risk of potential loss due to adverse movements in market rates, including foreign currency fluctuations, changing interest rates, decreases in residual values of assets and increases in commodity prices;Nothing
1064;Foreign currency fluctuations  Our financial results are reported in U;Nothing
1065;S;Nothing
1066;dollars and a significant portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in currencies other than U;Nothing
1067;S;Nothing
1068;dollars, in particular Euros, Canadian dollars and pounds sterling;Nothing
1069;Our results of operations are therefore affected by movements in these currencies against the U;Nothing
1070;S;Nothing
1071;dollar;Nothing
1072;Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values could therefore have a significant impact on our future profitability;Nothing
1073;Interest rate risk  We are exposed to fluctuation in our future cash flows arising from changes in interest rates through our variable-rate financial assets and liabilities, including long-term debt synthetically converted to variable interest rates, and through certain financing commitments and off-balance sheet pension obligations;Nothing
1074;For these items, cash flows could be impacted by changes in benchmark rates such as LIBOR, EURIBOR or Banker?s Acceptance;Nothing
1075;In addition, we are exposed to gains and losses arising from changes in interest rates, which include marketability risk, through our financial instruments carried at fair value, including certain commercial aircraft loans and lease receivables, investments in securities, invested collateral and certain derivatives;Nothing
1076;Residual value risk  We are exposed to residual value risks through residual value guarantees (?RVG?) provided in support of regional aircraft sales;Nothing
1077;We may provide RVGs either directly to the customer or to the financing party that participates in the long-term financing associated with the sale of regional aircraft;Nothing
1078;RVGs are offered as a strip of the value of the aircraft and are always capped;Nothing
1079;If the underlying aircraft is sold at the end of the financing period (or during this period in limited circumstances), the resale value is compared to the RVG;Nothing
1080;We are required to make payments under these RVGs when the resale value of the aircraft falls within the strip covered by the guarantee;Nothing
1081;Commodity price risk  We are exposed to commodity price risk relating principally to fluctuations in the cost of materials used in the supply chain, such as aluminum, titanium, advanced aluminum alloy and steel, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations;Nothing
1082;34    USE OF PROCEEDS  We estimate that the net proceeds from this offering of notes, after deducting the commissions payable to the initial purchasers and fees and expenses relating to our Refinancing Plan, will be approximately $1,049 million (using the noon rate published by the Bank of Canada on October 19, 2010, which was 31;Nothing

1975;"Adapting to the new economic reality   BA?s results were impacted by this recession but we persevere in our actions   The aerospace industry is cyclical and BA has been impacted by this recession: ? significant reduction in new orders and 202 aircraft order cancellations received in fiscal year 2010, added   to the 41 cancellations in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009;  ? lower customers? advances for both business and commercial aircraft, consistent with low net order   intake; ? lower selling prices for business aircraft;  ? disruption costs in connection with changes in production rates; and  ? write-down of pre-owned aircraft inventories";Nothing

2274;We continue to monitor standards to be issued by the  IASB, but we do not expect these new standards to be mandatory for our fiscal 2012 financial statements;Nothing

2276;However we will only make final decisions regarding early adoption of any new  standards as they are issued by the IASB;Nothing
2277;IFRS 1 generally requires that a first-time adopter apply IFRS accounting policies retrospectively to all periods  presented in its first IFRS financial statements;Nothing
2278;IFRS 1 also provides certain mandatory and optional exemptions  to the full retrospective application;Nothing
2279;The significant optional exemptions that we expect to apply are described  within the relevant accounting policy below, along with the expected opening balance sheet impact of each  choice;Nothing
2280;The following are some of our key changes in accounting policies, which we expect will have significant impacts  with respect to the recognition and measurement of certain balance sheet and income statement items;Nothing
2281;Unless  otherwise indicated, all changes in accounting policy will be applied retrospectively;Nothing
2282;Accounting  policy     Key differences in accounting treatment     Potential key impacts   We elected to immediately recognize all  actuarial gains and losses directly in equity,  rather than amortize these through earnings  as done under Canadian GAAP;Nothing
2283;Opening balance sheet: A decrease in accrued benefit  assets, an increase in accrued benefit liabilities and a  decrease in equity;Nothing
2284;Subsequent to transition: Pension cost will no longer  include the amortization component of the net actuarial  losses at transition and future actuarial gains and losses will  be recorded directly in equity;Nothing
2285;Given our current deficit, this  change will result in a reduction of pension cost in the near  term;Nothing
2286;This policy choice will also give rise to higher volatility  of equity;Nothing
2287;Employee  benefits      Vested past service costs of defined benefit  plans must be expensed immediately, while  they are currently amortized over the  estimated weighted-average remaining  service life of plan participants;Nothing
2288;Opening balance sheet: A decrease in accrued benefit  assets, an increase in accrued benefit liabilities and a  decrease in equity;Nothing
2289;Subsequent to transition: Plan amendments for vested  past service costs will be recorded as pension cost when  granted;Nothing
2290;We elected, under IFRS, to record interest  costs and expected return on plan assets in  financing income and financing expense,  rather than as part of pension cost;Nothing
2291;Opening balance sheet: No significant impact is expected;Nothing
2292;Subsequent to transition: Apart from the fact that these  amounts will be recorded as financing income and financing  expense, no significant impact is expected;Nothing
2293;Under certain circumstances, an additional  minimum liability will be recognized under  the rules of IFRIC 14, ?The limit on a defined  benefit asset, minimum funding  requirements and their interaction?;Nothing
2294;Changes to this amount will be recorded  directly to equity;Nothing
2295;Opening balance sheet: Accrued benefit assets will  decrease, accrued benefit liabilities will increase and equity  will decrease;Nothing
2296;Subsequent to transition: Volatility in accrued benefit  assets and liabilities and equity will arise as a result of this  change;Nothing
2297;88         Accounting  policy     Key differences in accounting treatment     Potential key impacts   Revenue  recognition  of medium  and large  business  aircraft    Revenues from the sale of medium and large  business aircraft will be recognized only  when the completed aircraft is delivered to  the customer (no longer recognized upon  green aircraft deliveries, i;Nothing
2298;e;Nothing
2299;before exterior  painting and installation of interiors and  optional avionics);Nothing
2300;Opening balance sheet: The reversal of sales of green  aircraft will increase inventories and advances on aerospace  programs and decrease receivables and accounts payable  and accrued liabilities, with a decrease in equity for the net  amount;Nothing
2301;Subsequent to transition: In an environment where  production rates and/or pricing are increasing or decreasing,  there may be a significant impact on EBIT due to the change  in the timing of revenue recognition for medium and large  business aircraft;Nothing
2302;Government  Assistance   Government assistance contingently  repayable based on aircraft deliveries must  be recognized as a liability when it is  probable that the conditions for repayment  will be met;Nothing
2303;Under Canadian GAAP, such  government assistance is recorded as a  reduction of the cost of the aerospace  program tooling or R&D costs when received  and repayments are recorded in cost of sales  at the time of delivery of the aircraft;Nothing
2304;Opening balance sheet: An increase in liabilities, with most  of the adjustment recorded to equity;Nothing
2305;The balance of the  adjustment will increase aerospace program tooling;Nothing
2306;Subsequent to transition: The cost of sales will no longer  include repayments of government assistance and future  program tooling amortization will be higher;Nothing
2307;Additional  interest expense will arise from the recorded liability;Nothing
2308;Intangible  assets   We decided to use the units-of-production  method of amortization for our aerospace  program tooling under IFRS, while under  Canadian GAAP we use the straight-line  method of amortization;Nothing
2309;Vendor R&D expenditures incurred on our  behalf by suppliers and repayable upon  delivery of aircraft must be recognized as  aerospace program tooling upon evidence of  successful development;Nothing
2310;Under Canadian  GAAP, such costs are only recognized when  the amounts become payable;Nothing
2311;Opening balance sheet: A decrease in aerospace program  tooling and an increase in liabilities, with a net adjustment to  equity;Nothing
2312;Subsequent to transition: The depreciation expense for  aerospace program tooling will be based on production of  aircraft rather than the passage of time;Nothing
2313;Vendor R&D  expenditures will be recorded earlier as aerospace program  tooling, which will result in earlier depreciation of these  amounts;Nothing
2314;A counter credit to liabilities will be recorded as  vendor R&D expenditures are incurred and interest expense  will arise from the related liability;Nothing
2315;Provisions  and  contingent  liabilities     IFRS requires a provision to be recognized  when it is probable (more likely than not) that  an outflow of resource will be required to  settle the obligation, while a higher threshold  is used under Canadian GAAP;Nothing
2316;IFRS also requires a provision to be  recognized when a contract becomes  onerous, which Canadian GAAP only  requires recognition of such a liability in  certain situations;Nothing
2317;Opening balance sheet and subsequent to transition: We  have not completed our assessment of the impact;Nothing
2318;It is  possible that additional provisions will be recognized under  IFRS;Nothing
2319;Long-term  contracts   Accounting for long-term contracts requires  base contracts and options to be combined  into a single contract unless certain criteria  are met;Nothing
2320;Less restrictive criteria under IFRS,  namely the absence of a combining  restriction when the base contract and the  option have significantly different margins,  will result in additional contracts being  combined;Nothing
2321;Opening balance sheet: Certain contract losses previously  recorded will be reversed, resulting in an increase in long- term contract inventories and an increase in equity;Nothing
2322;Subsequent to transition: Additional combining of base  contract with options should generally result in the  recognition of positive cumulative catch-up adjustments  when option contracts are signed;Nothing
2323;89         Accounting  policy     Key differences in accounting treatment     Potential key impacts   Various changes in accounting policy under  IFRS will also impact the corresponding  deferred tax asset or liability, unless a  valuation allowance is required;Nothing
2324;Opening balance sheet: An overall net increase in  deferred tax assets is expected;Nothing
2325;Subsequent to transition: The impact will depend on the  net amount of all differences in accounting policy;Nothing
2326;Income taxes   Tax consequences of a transaction recorded  in other comprehensive income or directly in  equity in previous periods must be recorded  in other comprehensive income or directly in  equity (i;Nothing
2327;e;Nothing
2328;backward tracing);Nothing
2329;Under  Canadian GAAP, all subsequent changes in  deferred income taxes are recorded through  earnings;Nothing
2330;Opening balance sheet: No significant impact is expected;Nothing
2331;Subsequent to transition: The impact on earnings will  depend on the extent of changes to deferred income taxes  that will be recorded in other comprehensive income or  directly to equity;Nothing
2332;Lease  accounting   IFRS requires a qualitative and quantitative  assessment of lease classification while the  Canadian GAAP requirement is based on  quantitative tests;Nothing
2333;Opening balance sheet: Our pre-owned aircraft off- balance sheet sale and leaseback facilities will be  accounted for on balance sheet, leading to an increase in  assets and liabilities;Nothing
2334;Subsequent to transition: No significant impact on  earnings is expected;Nothing
2335;More lease arrangements entered into  following transition may also require on-balance sheet  treatment under IFRS;Nothing
2336;Presentation  and disclosure   We must present a classified balance sheet  under IFRS to highlight the current and non- current portion of our assets and liabilities;Nothing
2337;The classification will be based on the  operating cycles of the groups for operating  components, and on a one year basis or as  otherwise required by IFRS for the other  components;Nothing
2338;Opening balance sheet and subsequent to transition:  The format of the balance sheet will change to reflect the  new classification;Nothing
2339;Cumulative  translation  adjustment   Under the exemption allowed by IFRS 1, we  decided to eliminate all cumulative foreign  exchange gains and losses recorded in CTA  at transition;Nothing
2340;Opening balance sheet: An elimination of the $117 million  debit balance in the CTA in equity, with an offsetting  decrease in retained earnings;Nothing
2341;No impact on total equity;Nothing
2342;Subsequent to transition: No significant change;Nothing
2343;Impairment of  long-lived  assets      IFRS requires a one-step impairment test for  identifying and measuring impairment,  comparing an asset?s carrying value to the  higher of its value in use and fair value less  cost to sell;Nothing
2344;Under Canadian GAAP,  impairment is based on discounted cash  flows only if an asset?s undiscounted cash  flows are below its carrying value;Nothing
2345;Previously recognized impairment losses  must be reversed when a change in  circumstances indicates that the impairment  has been reduced, other than for goodwill  and indefinite-lived intangible assets;Nothing
2346;Opening balance sheet: We have not yet completed our  assessment of the impact;Nothing
2347;Subsequent to transition: The one-step impairment test  under IFRS may result in more frequent write-downs of  assets;Nothing
2348;Reversals of previous write-downs may be required  in future periods;Nothing
2349;The IASB is contemplating issuing a new standard to replace the current IAS 31, ?Interests in joint ventures?,  which is expected in the second quarter of calendar year 2010;Nothing
2350;It is expected that the new standard will require  the use of the equity method to account for all joint ventures;Nothing
2351;Under the current standard, the use of the equity  method or proportionate consolidation is allowed;Nothing
2352;Joint ventures must be proportionally consolidated under  Canadian GAAP;Nothing
2353;We have not yet determined whether we will adopt the new standard on transition or what would  be our accounting policy under the current standard if we do not adopt the new standard on transition;Nothing
2354;When our  accounting policy for recognition of joint ventures will change from proportionate consolidation to the equity  method, this will result in a reduction of various balance sheet items as our net investment in joint ventures will   90       then be recorded as a one-line item, with no significant impact on equity;Nothing
2355;For the income statement, the main  impact of using the equity method will be a reduction in revenues and costs, as well as a reduction in EBIT as our  share of the net results of joint ventures will be reported in EBIT net of related tax;Nothing
2356;Below are selected additional changes in accounting policies, which we do not expect to have a significant impact  on our consolidated financial statements;Nothing
2357;Accounting  policy     Differences in accounting treatment   Property,  plant and  equipment   IFRS requires separate amortization of major components of an asset;Nothing
2358;This requirement being less explicit  under Canadian GAAP, we identified a greater number of major components that will be amortized  separately under IFRS;Nothing
2359;Depreciation expense will therefore be different under IFRS;Nothing
2360;Borrowing  costs   The computation of amounts to be capitalized may be different with regard to capitalization period, scope  of qualifying assets and/or rates used;Nothing
2361;Under the exemption allowed by IFRS 1, we decided to begin capitalization of borrowing costs to qualifying  assets effective February 19, 2007, the launch date of the CRJ1000 aircraft program;Nothing
2362;Aerospace program  tooling and equity will decrease in our opening balance sheet as a result;Nothing
2363;Financial  instruments   Under IFRS, we will assess the effectiveness of hedge relationships quantitatively and hedge  ineffectiveness will be recognized in net income;Nothing
2364;Credit and liquidity risks will be excluded from the  assessment of effectiveness and will be recognized in net income;Nothing
2365;Under Canadian GAAP, a quantitative assessment of hedge effectiveness is not required if certain specific  criteria are met (known as the shortcut method or the critical-terms match method);Nothing
2366;There will be greater volatility in earnings under IFRS as a result;Nothing
2367;Service  concession  arrangements     IFRS provides specific guidance on service concession arrangements, where Canadian GAAP does not  explicitly address such arrangements;Nothing
2368;We do not currently participate directly in service concession arrangements;Nothing
2369;However, certain of our  investments accounted for under the equity method will be subject to the service concession arrangement  rules;Nothing
2370;As a result, the amounts recorded under the equity method for such investments may be different  under IFRS;Nothing
2371;Business  combinations   We will elect to apply IFRS prospectively for business combinations from the date of transition to IFRS;Nothing
2372;There will be no impact to our consolidated financial statements as a result of this election;Nothing
2373;Basis of  consolidation      Under IFRS, the requirement to consolidate an entity is determined based on control, with additional  consideration for special purpose entities;Nothing
2374;Under Canadian GAAP a similar control model applies, except in  the case of special purpose entities, which are accounted for under the VIE model;Nothing
2375;No significant impact is  expected to our consolidated financial statements as a result of this difference;Nothing
2376;The differences identified in this document should not be regarded as an exhaustive list and other changes may  result from our conversion to IFRS;Nothing
2377;Furthermore, the disclosed impacts of our conversion to IFRS reflect our most  recent assumptions, estimates and expectations, including our assessment of the IFRS expected to be applicable  at time of conversion;Nothing
2378;As a result of changes in circumstances, such as economic conditions or operations, and  the inherent uncertainty from the use of assumptions, the actual impacts of our conversion to IFRS may be  different from those presented above;Nothing

3213;In the last market downturn following the September 11, 2001 events, we executed a  turnaround that involved some difficult decisions, including downsizing our operations, reducing our workforce and  reorganizing into market segments (business aircraft, commercial aircraft and customer services) to improve  accountability;Nothing

3216;However, as anticipated last fiscal year, our revenues, EBIT margin and free cash flow have been negatively  impacted in fiscal year 2010;Nothing
3217;The recession affected our customers? financial situations and their ability to secure  financing, resulting in a lower number of commercial and business aircraft orders, as well as in a higher than  normal level of order cancellations and deferrals of deliveries;Nothing

3219;For business aircraft, high levels of order cancellations and deferrals of deliveries were experienced in  fiscal year 2010, along with pricing pressures due in part to increased pre-owned business jet inventories;Nothing
3220;For  commercial aircraft, we experienced one customer order cancellation and decided to terminate a 15 aircraft firm  order purchase agreement due to another customer?s uncertain situation;Nothing
3221;In addition, in fiscal year 2010, a  number of commercial customers deferred their aircraft deliveries;Nothing
3222;In fiscal year 2011, we expect to deliver approximately 15% and 20% fewer business and commercial aircraft  respectively compared to fiscal year 2010;Nothing
3223;Overall, we expect improvements to lag economic recovery, therefore  our EBIT margin for fiscal year 2011 is expected to be at a similar level as fiscal year 2010, but profitability should  be higher in the second part of the year, reflecting the anticipated improvement in the pricing environment;Nothing
3224;Our  free cash flow in fiscal year 2011 is expected to be essentially neutral, as cash flows from operating activities will  be used to finance capital expenditures, including the significant investments in product development, which are  expected to approximately double compared to the $611 million incurred in fiscal year 2010;Nothing
3225;However, our free  cash flow for the first part of fiscal year 2011 should be negative due to the anticipated delivery profile of our  regional aircraft, including the entry into service of the CRJ1000 aircraft in the second part of the year, and the  anticipated gradual improvement in order intake taking place mostly in the second half of the year;Nothing
3226;Our strategy is to turn obstacles into  opportunity, as we have  successfully done following the  downturn of calendar year 2001;Nothing

4470;The impacts of  general economic risk on our business is discussed in Overview, BA and BT;Nothing
4471;Business  environment  risk  Business environment risk is the risk of potential loss due to external risk factors, more  specifically the financial condition of the airline industry and major rail operators, government  policies related to import and export restrictions, changing priorities and possible spending  cuts by government agencies, government support to export sales, world trade policies,  competition from other businesses, as well as scope clauses in pilot union agreements  restricting the operation of smaller jetliners by major airlines or by their regional affiliates;Nothing
4472;In  addition, acts of terrorism, global health risks and political instability, or the outbreak of war or  continued hostilities in certain regions of the world, could result in lower orders or the  rescheduling or cancellation of part of the existing order backlog for some of our products;Nothing
4473;"Operational risk Operational risk is the risk of potential loss due to risks related to developing new products  and services; actions of business partners; product performance warranty and casualty claim  losses; regulatory and legal risks; environmental, health and safety risks; as well as  dependence on customers, suppliers and human resources";Nothing
4474;In addition, large and complex  projects are common in our businesses, most often structured as fixed-price contracts;Nothing

4480;Continued cost and yield pressure in the airline industry puts pressure on the selling price of BA?s products;Nothing
4481;An  increased supply of used aircraft as companies downsize or discontinue operations also adds downward pressure  on selling price of new and used business and commercial aircraft;Nothing
4482;We are faced with the challenge of finding  ways to reduce costs and improve productivity to sustain a favourable market position at acceptable profit  margins;Nothing
4483;The loss of any major commercial airline as a customer or the termination of a contract could  significantly reduce our revenues and profitability;Nothing
4484;183    Rail industry financial condition    World economic and financial conditions may have a negative impact on some rail operators, particularly in the  freight segment;Nothing
4485;Unfavourable economic conditions may result in projects being reduced in size, postponed or  even cancelled;Nothing
4486;Such actions by rail operators or governments would negatively impact BT?s order intake and  revenues and put pressure on its cost structure;Nothing
4487;Operational risk    Developing new products and services    The principal markets in which we operate experience change due to the introduction of new technologies;Nothing
4488;To  meet our customers? needs, we must continuously design new products, update existing products and services,  and invest and develop new technologies, which may require significant capital investments;Nothing

4492;Non-compliance with current  or future regulatory requirements imposed by Transport Canada, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the  European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), the Transport Safety Institute and national rail regulatory bodies or  other regulatory authorities, could result in the service interruption of our products;Nothing
4493;Fixed-price commitments and project execution    We have historically offered, and will continue to offer, virtually all of our products on fixed-price contracts, rather  than contracts under which payment is determined solely on a time-and-material basis;Nothing
4494;Generally, we may not  terminate these contracts unilaterally;Nothing
4495;We are exposed to risks associated with these contracts, including unexpected technological problems, difficulties  with our partners and subcontractors and logistical difficulties that could lead to cost overruns and late delivery  penalties;Nothing
4496;In addition, long-term contract revenues and costs are based, in part, on estimates that are subject to a  number of assumptions, such as forecasted costs of materials, inflation rates, foreign exchange rates, labour  productivity, employment levels and salaries, and are influenced by the nature and complexity of the work to be  performed, the impact of change orders and the impact of delayed delivery;Nothing
4497;Business partners   In some of the projects carried out through consortia or other partnership vehicles in BT, all partners are jointly  and severally liable to the customer;Nothing
4498;The success of these partnerships is dependent on satisfactory performance  by our business partners and us;Nothing
4499;Failure of the business partners to fulfill their contractual obligations could  subject us to additional financial and performance obligations that could result in increased costs, unforeseen  delays, losses or write-down of assets;Nothing
4500;In addition, a partner withdrawing from a consortium during the bid phase,  in particular in the BT systems business, may result in the loss of potential order intake;Nothing
4501;Product performance warranty and casualty claim losses     The products that we manufacture are highly complex and sophisticated and may contain defects that are difficult  to detect and correct;Nothing
4502;Our products are subject to stringent certification or approval requirements, as well as  detailed specifications listed in the individual contracts with customers;Nothing

4506;Correcting such defects could require significant capital  investment;Nothing
4507;In addition, due to the nature of our business, we may be subject to liability claims arising from accidents or  disasters involving our products, or products for which we have provided services, including claims for serious   184    personal injuries or death, and these accidents may include accidents caused by climatic factors, or by pilot or  driver error;Nothing
4508;We cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover one or more substantial  claims;Nothing
4509;Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain insurance coverage at acceptable  levels and cost in the future;Nothing
4510;Regulatory and legal risks     We are subject to numerous risks relating to new regulations or legal proceedings to which we are currently a  party or that could develop in the future;Nothing
4511;We become party to lawsuits in the ordinary course of our business,  including those involving allegations of late deliveries of goods or services, product liability, product defects,  quality problems and intellectual property infringement;Nothing

4514;Environmental regulatory requirements, or enforcements thereof, may become more stringent in the future, and  we may incur additional costs to be compliant with such future requirements or enforcements;Nothing
4515;In addition, we may  have contractual or other liabilities for environmental matters relating to businesses, products or properties that  we have in the past closed, sold or otherwise disposed of, or that we close, sell or dispose of in the future;Nothing
4516;Customers    For certain of our products, we depend on a limited number of customers and we believe that we will continue to  depend on a limited number of customers;Nothing
4517;Consequently, the loss of such customers could result in fewer sales  or a lower market share;Nothing
4518;Since the majority of BT?s customers are public companies or operate under public  contracts, BT?s order intake is also dependent on public budgets and spending policies;Nothing
4519;Suppliers    Our manufacturing operations are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for the delivery of raw materials  (aluminum, advanced aluminum alloy, titanium) and services and major systems (engines, wings, nacelles and  fuselages) in BA, and raw materials (steel, aluminum) and major systems (brakes, doors, heating, ventilation and  air conditioning) in BT;Nothing
4520;A failure to meet performance specifications, quality standards, and delivery schedules by  one or more suppliers could adversely affect our ability to meet our commitments to customers;Nothing
4521;Some of these  suppliers participate in the development of products such as aircraft or rolling stock platforms;Nothing
4522;They also  participate in the subsequent delivery of materials and major components and own some of the intellectual  property on the key components they develop;Nothing
4523;Our contracts with these suppliers are therefore on a long-term  basis;Nothing
4524;The replacement of suppliers could be costly and take a significant amount of time;Nothing
4525;Human resources (including collective agreements)     Human resource risk would arise if we were unable to recruit, retain, and motivate highly skilled employees,  including those involved in the R&D activities that are essential to our success;Nothing
4526;In addition, we are party to several  collective agreements that are due to expire at various times in the future;Nothing
4527;If we are unable to renew these  collective agreements on similar terms as they become subject to renegotiation from time to time, this could result  in work stoppages or other labour disturbances and/or increased costs of labour;Nothing
4528;185    Financing risk    Liquidity and access to capital markets     We require continued access to capital markets to support our activities;Nothing
4529;To satisfy our financing needs, we rely  on cash resources, debt and cash flow generated from operations;Nothing
4530;A decline in credit ratings, a significant  reduction in the surety or financing market global capacity, significant changes in market interest rates or general  economic conditions, or an adverse perception in capital markets of our financial condition or prospects, could all  significantly impede our ability to access capital markets;Nothing
4531;Credit ratings may be impacted by many external factors  beyond our control and, accordingly, no assurance can be given that our credit ratings may not be reduced in the  future;Nothing
4532;"Restrictive debt covenants   The indentures governing certain of our indebtedness and credit facilities contain covenants that, among other  things, restrict our ability to:   ? incur additional debt and provide guarantees;  ? repay subordinated debt;  ? create or permit certain liens;  ? use the proceeds from the sale of assets and subsidiary stock;  ? pay dividends and make certain other disbursements;  ? allow our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments;  ? engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and  ? enter into certain consolidations, mergers or transfers of all or certain assets";Nothing
4533;These restrictions could impair our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs, or engage in other  business activities that may be in our interest;Nothing
4534;We are subject to various financial covenants under our BA and BT letter of credit facilities and our revolving  credit facility, which must be met on a quarterly basis;Nothing
4535;The BA letter of credit and revolving facilities includes  financial covenants requiring a minimum EBITDA to fixed charges ratio, a maximum debt to EBITDA ratio and a  minimum liquidity level, all calculated based on an adjusted consolidated basis (i;Nothing
4536;e;Nothing
4537;excluding BT);Nothing
4538;The BT  financial covenants require minimum equity and liquidity levels as well as a maximum debt to EBITDA ratio, all  calculated based on BT standalone data;Nothing
4539;These terms and ratios are defined in the respective agreements and do  not correspond to our global metrics or to the specific terms used in the MD&A;Nothing
4540;Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control;Nothing
4541;A breach of any of  these agreements or our inability to comply with these covenants could also result in a default under these  facilities, which would permit our banks to request the immediate cash collateralization of all outstanding letters of  credit, and our bond holders and other lenders to declare amounts owed to them to be immediately payable;Nothing
4542;If  repayment of our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our indebtedness or borrow sufficient  funds to refinance it;Nothing
4543;Financing support provided for the benefit of certain customers     From time to time, we provide aircraft financing support to customers;Nothing
4544;We may also provide interim financing  while a permanent financing solution is being arranged, which includes loans made to customers and, on a limited  basis, the leasing of aircraft to customers;Nothing
4545;We face the risk that certain customers may not be able to obtain  permanent financing;Nothing
4546;We may also provide, directly or indirectly, credit and residual value guarantees to airlines to support financing for  airlines or to support financings by certain SPEs created solely i) to purchase our commercial aircraft and to lease  those aircraft to airlines and ii) to purchase financial assets related to commercial aircraft manufactured by BA;Nothing
4547;Under these arrangements, we are obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event that the  original debtor or lessee does not make the lease or loan payments, or if the market or resale value of the aircraft  is below the guaranteed residual value amount at an agreed-upon date;Nothing
4548;A substantial portion of these guarantees  has been extended to support original debtors or lessees with less than investment grade credit;Nothing
4549;186    Government support     From time to time, we receive various types of financial government support;Nothing
4550;Some of these financial support  programs require that we pay amounts to the government at the time of delivery of products, contingent on  achievement of an agreed-upon minimum level of related product sales;Nothing
4551;The level of government support reflects  government policy and depends on fiscal spending levels and other political and economic factors;Nothing
4552;We cannot  predict if future government-sponsored support will be available;Nothing
4553;The loss or any substantial reduction in the  availability of government support could negatively impact our liquidity assumptions regarding the development of  aircraft or new rail products and services;Nothing
4554;In addition, any future government support received by our competitors  could have a negative impact on our competitiveness, sales and market share;Nothing
4555;Market risk    Foreign currency fluctuations     Our financial results are reported in U;Nothing
4556;S;Nothing
4557;dollars and a significant portion of our sales and operating costs are  realized in currencies other than U;Nothing
4558;S;Nothing

4560;Our  results of operations are therefore affected by movements in these currencies against the U;Nothing
4561;S;Nothing
4562;dollar;Nothing
4563;Significant  long-term fluctuations in relative currency values could therefore have a significant impact on our future  profitability;Nothing
4564;Interest rate risk   We are exposed to fluctuation in our future cash flows arising from changes in interest rates through our variable- rate financial assets and liabilities, including long-term debt synthetically converted to variable interest rates, and  through certain financing commitments and off-balance sheet pension obligations;Nothing
4565;For these items, cash flows  could be impacted by changes in benchmark rates such as Libor, Euribor or Banker?s Acceptance;Nothing
4566;In addition, we  are exposed to gains and losses arising from changes in interest rates, which include marketability risk, through  our financial instruments carried at fair value, including certain commercial aircraft loans and lease receivables,  investments in securities, invested collateral and certain derivatives;Nothing
4567;Residual value risk   We are exposed to residual value risks through residual value guarantees (?RVG?) provided in support of regional  aircraft sales;Nothing
4568;We may provide RVGs either directly to the customer or to the financing party that participates in  the long-term financing associated with the sale of regional aircraft;Nothing
4569;RVGs are offered as a strip of the value of the  aircraft and are always capped;Nothing
4570;If the underlying aircraft is sold at the end of the financing period (or during this  period in limited circumstances), the resale value is compared to the RVG;Nothing
4571;We are required to make payments  under these RVGs when the resale value of the aircraft falls within the strip covered by the guarantee;Nothing
4572;Commodity price risk   We are exposed to commodity price risk relating principally to fluctuations in the cost of materials used in the  supply chain, such as aluminum, titanium, advanced aluminum alloy and steel, which could adversely affect our  business, financial condition and results of operations;Nothing
4573;187    ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS    Changes in accounting policies    Business combinations, consolidated financial statements and non-controlling interests  In January 2009, the AcSB released Section 1582 ?Business combinations?, Section 1601 ?Consolidated financial  statements? and Section 1602 ?Non-controlling interests?, which replace Section 1581 ?Business combinations?  and Section 1600 ?Consolidated financial statements?;Nothing
4574;"Section 1582 provides the Canadian equivalent to IFRS 3 ""Business Combinations""";Nothing
4575;The new recommendations  require measuring business acquisitions at the fair value of the acquired business, including the measurement at  fair value of items such as non-controlling interests and contingent payment considerations;Nothing
4576;Also, the previously  unrecognized deferred tax assets related to the acquiree subsequent to the business combination are recognized  in the consolidated statements of income rather than as a reduction in goodwill;Nothing
4577;In addition, business acquisition- related costs are expensed as incurred;Nothing
4578;The adoption of Section 1582 should have a material effect on the accounting for business combinations that  occur subsequent to February 1, 2009;Nothing
4579;Past acquisitions are not restated;Nothing
4580;Section 1601, together with Section 1602, replaces Section 1600;Nothing
4581;Section 1601 establishes standards for the  preparation of consolidated financial statements and is aligned with the corresponding provisions of Section 1600;Nothing
4582;Section 1602 is aligned with the corresponding provisions of IAS 27, ?Consolidated and Separate Financial  Statements?, and establishes standards for accounting for non-controlling interests in a subsidiary subsequent to  a business combination;Nothing
4583;"Section 1602 introduces a number of changes, for example:   ? in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of shareholders? equity, non-controlling  interests are now presented as a separate component of shareholders? equity rather than as a liability;    ? non-controlling interests are no longer recorded as a deduction of net income and total comprehensive  income as a result of their presentation in equity;   ? for the purpose of computing EPS, net income is attributed between the shareholders of Bombardier Inc";Nothing
4584;and the non-controlling interests based on their respective economic interests;Nothing
4585;"The components of OCI  are attributed following the same logic; and   ? changes in non-controlling ownership interests not resulting in a loss of control are accounted for as  equity transactions, with no gains and losses recorded in the consolidated statements of income";Nothing
4586;We have elected to early adopt these sections, effective February 1, 2009, in order to more closely align  ourselves with IFRS and mitigate the impact of adopting IFRS at the changeover date;Nothing
4587;In accordance with the  transitional provisions, these sections have been applied prospectively, except for the presentation requirements  for non-controlling interests, which must be applied retrospectively;Nothing
4588;The adoption of these sections did not have a  significant impact on our consolidated financial statements but gave rise to the above-mentioned reclassifications  of non-controlling interests;Nothing
4589;Future changes in accounting policies    IFRS  In February 2008, the AcSB confirmed that Canadian GAAP for publicly accountable entities will be changed to  IFRS effective in calendar year 2011;Nothing
4590;IFRS uses a conceptual framework similar to Canadian GAAP, but there  are significant differences in recognition, measurement and disclosures;Nothing
4591;Our first reporting under IFRS is required  for interim and annual financial statements beginning on February 1, 2011;Nothing
4592;We have developed a plan anchored  around four phases to convert our Consolidated Financial Statements to IFRS;Nothing
4593;For more details on our IFRS  conversion plan, refer to the IFRS conversion section of Overview;Nothing
4594;188    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS    An important portion of our consolidated balance sheets is composed of financial instruments;Nothing
4595;Our financial  assets include cash and cash equivalents, invested collateral, trade receivables, commercial aircraft loans and  leases receivables, investment in securities, investments in VIEs, restricted cash and derivative financial  instruments with a positive fair value;Nothing
4596;Our financial liabilities include trade account payables, certain accrued  liabilities, related liabilities in connection with the sale of commercial aircraft, accrued interest, certain  payroll-related liabilities, long-term debt and derivative financial instruments with a negative fair value;Nothing
4597;Derivative  financial instruments are mainly used to manage our exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks;Nothing
4598;They  consist mostly of forward foreign exchange contracts, interest-rate swap agreements, cross-currency interest-rate  swap agreements and interest-rate cap agreements;Nothing
4599;The classification of our financial instruments as well as the  revenues, expenses, gains and losses associated with these instruments is provided in Note 2 ? Summary of  significant accounting policies and in Note 3 ? Financial instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements;Nothing
4600;The use of financial instruments exposes the Corporation primarily to credit, liquidity and market risks, including  foreign exchange and interest rates;Nothing
4601;A description on how we manage these risks is included in Note 23 ?  Financial risk management to the Consolidated Financial Statements and in the Strategy section in Overview;Nothing
4602;CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES    Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements;Nothing
4603;The  preparation of financial statements, in conformity with Canadian GAAP, requires the use of estimates, judgment  and assumptions;Nothing
4604;Critical accounting estimates, which are evaluated on a regular ongoing basis and can change  from period to period, are described in this section;Nothing
4605;An accounting estimate is considered critical if the estimate  requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made, if  different estimates could reasonably have been used, or if changes in the estimate that could have a material  impact on our financial condition or results of operations are likely to occur from period to period;Nothing
4606;The sensitivity analysis included in this section should be used with caution as the changes are hypothetical and  the impact of changes in each key assumption may not be linear;Nothing
4607;Fair value of financial instruments   All financial instruments are required to be recognized at their fair value on initial recognition;Nothing
4608;Subsequent  measurement is at amortized cost or fair value depending on the classifications of the financial instruments;Nothing
4609;Financial instruments classified as HFT or AFS are carried at fair value;Nothing
4610;Fair value amounts disclosed in the Consolidated Financial Statements represent our estimate of the price at  which a financial instrument could be exchanged in a market in an arm's length transaction between  knowledgeable, willing parties who are under no compulsion to act;Nothing
4611;They are point-in-time estimates that may  change in subsequent reporting periods due to market conditions or other factors;Nothing
4612;Fair value is determined by  reference to quoted prices in the most advantageous active market for that instrument to which we have  immediate access;Nothing
4613;However, there is no active market for most of our financial instruments;Nothing
4614;In the absence of an  active market, we determine fair value based on internal or external valuation models, such as stochastic models,  option-pricing models and discounted cash flow models;Nothing
4615;Fair value determined using valuation models requires  the use of assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows, discount rates, the  creditworthiness of the borrower, the aircraft?s expected future value, default probability, generic industrial bond  spreads and marketability risk;Nothing
4616;In determining these assumptions, we use primarily external, readily observable  market inputs including factors such as interest rates, credit ratings, credit spreads, default probability, currency  rates, and price and rate volatilities, as applicable;Nothing
4617;Assumptions or inputs that are not based on observable  market data are used when external data are not available;Nothing
4618;These calculations represent our best estimates  based on a range of methodologies and assumptions;Nothing
4619;Since they are based on estimates, these fair values may  not be realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the instruments;Nothing
4620;A detailed description of the methods and assumptions used to measure the fair value of our financial instruments  and their fair value hierarchy is discussed in Note 22 ? Fair value of financial instruments to the Consolidated  Financial Statements;Nothing
4621;189    Sensitivity analysis  Our main exposures to changes in the fair value of financial instruments are related to foreign exchange and  interest rate derivative financial instruments and commercial aircraft loans and lease receivables;Nothing
4622;These financial  instruments are all measured at fair value in our Consolidated Financial Statements;Nothing
4623;Derivative financial instruments  Derivative financial instruments are mostly exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates;Nothing
4624;For  derivative financial instruments exposed to foreign currency movements, an appreciation of 10% in the following  currencies would have had the following impact on EBT, before giving effect to the related hedged items, and on  OCI for derivatives designated in a cash flow hedge relationship, before income taxes, as at January 31, 2010:    Gain (loss)  CAD/USD   GBP/USD  USD/Euro  Euro/USD  Other  Impact on EBT  $ 11  $ - (53)  $ 141  $ 15  Impact on OCI before income taxes  $ 183  $ 74 (49)  $ 10  $ (23)   Refer to Note 23 ? Financial risk management of the Consolidated Financial Statements which presents a foreign  exchange rate sensitivity of the Corporation?s financial instruments recorded on its balance sheets, which give  effect to economic hedges;Nothing
4625;Since the majority of our interest rate derivative financial instruments are designated in a fair value hedge  relationship, a shift of 100 basis points in the yield curves as at January 31, 2010 would have had no significant  impact on EBT;Nothing
4626;Commercial aircraft loans and lease receivables  Changes in the fair value of these financial instruments are mostly affected by changes in interest rates;Nothing
4627;Assuming a 100-basis point increase in interest rates as of January 31, 2010, EBT would have been negatively  impacted by $24 million for fiscal year 2010;Nothing
4628;Credit and residual value guarantees    We have issued credit and residual value guarantees in connection with the sale of commercial aircraft;Nothing
4629;Guarantees are initially recognized at fair value on the date the guarantees are unconditionally given;Nothing
4630;These  guarantees are subsequently remeasured using the settlement-value method;Nothing
4631;The settlement value represents an  estimate of what we expect to pay under these guarantees, so it does not take into consideration our own credit  risk in establishing the value;Nothing
4632;We use an internal valuation model based on stochastic simulations to estimate the value of these credit and  residual value guarantees;Nothing
4633;The value is calculated using current market assumptions for interest rates, published  credit ratings when available and default probabilities from rating agencies;Nothing
4634;We also perform internal credit  assessments to determine the credit risk of customers without a published credit rating;Nothing
4635;In addition, we use  aircraft residual value curves obtained from independent appraisers adjusted to reflect the specific factors of the  current aircraft market;Nothing
4636;Sensitivity analysis  Our main exposures to changes in the value of credit and residual value guarantees are related to the residual  value curves of the underlying aircraft and interest rate;Nothing
4637;The following are presented in isolation from one another;Nothing
4638;Assuming an adverse change of 1% in the residual value curves as at January 31, 2010, EBT would have been  negatively impacted by $18 million for fiscal year 2010;Nothing
4639;Assuming a positive change of 1% in the residual value  curves as at January 31, 2010, EBT would have been positively impacted by $11 million for fiscal year 2010;Nothing
4640;Assuming a 100-basis point decrease in interest rates as of January 31, 2010, EBT would have been negatively  impacted by $14 million for fiscal year 2010;Nothing
4641;Aerospace program tooling     Aerospace program tooling is amortized over ten years and is reviewed for impairment when certain events or  changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the tooling may not be recoverable;Nothing
4642;The  recoverability test is performed using undiscounted expected future net cash flows that are directly associated   190    with the asset?s use;Nothing
4643;An impairment charge is recorded when the undiscounted value of the expected future cash  flow is less than the carrying value of program tooling;Nothing
4644;The amount of impairment, if any, is measured as the  difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the program tooling;Nothing
4645;Estimates of net future cash flows  over the remaining useful life of program tooling are subject to uncertainties with respect to expected selling  prices;Nothing
4646;Long-term contracts   BT conducts most of its business under long-term contracts with customers;Nothing
4647;Revenues and margins from  long-term contracts relating to designing, engineering or manufacturing of products, including vehicle and  component overhaul, are mostly recognized using the percentage-of-completion method;Nothing
4648;For maintenance  contracts entered into on or after December 17, 2003, revenues and margins are recognized in proportion to the  total costs originally anticipated to be incurred at the beginning of the contract;Nothing
4649;The long-term nature of contracts  involves considerable use of estimates in determining total contract costs, revenues and percentage of  completion;Nothing
4650;Contract costs include material, direct labour, manufacturing overhead and other costs, such as warranty and  freight;Nothing
4651;Total contract costs are estimated based on forecasted costs of materials, inflation rates, foreign  exchange rates, labour productivity, and employment levels and salaries, and are driven by the nature and  complexity of the work to be performed, the impact of change orders and the impact of delayed delivery;Nothing
4652;Cost  estimates are based mainly on economic trends and projections, collective agreements, information provided by  suppliers and historical performance trends;Nothing
4653;Revenue estimates are based on the negotiated contract price adjusted for change orders, claims, penalties and  contract terms that provide for the adjustment of prices in the event of variations from projected inflationary  trends;Nothing
4654;Contract change orders and claims are included in revenue when they can be reliably estimated and  realization is probable;Nothing
4655;The percentage of completion is generally determined by comparing the actual costs incurred to the total costs  anticipated for the entire contract, excluding costs that are not representative of the measure of performance;Nothing
4656;Recognized revenues and margins are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion;Nothing
4657;We conduct  quarterly reviews, and a detailed annual review as part of our annual budget process, of our estimated costs to  complete, percentage-of-completion estimates and revenues and margins recognized, on a contract-by-contract  basis;Nothing
4658;The effect of any revision is accounted for by way of a cumulative catch-up adjustment in the period in  which the revision takes place;Nothing
4659;If a contract review indicates a negative gross margin, the entire expected loss on the contract is recognized in  the period in which the negative gross margin is identified;Nothing
4660;Sensitivity analysis  A 1% increase in the estimated future costs to complete all ongoing contracts accounted for under the  percentage-of-completion method in BT would have decreased margin by approximately $66 million for fiscal year  2010;Nothing
4661;Goodwill     Goodwill recorded is mainly the result of the purchase of Adtranz;Nothing
4662;Goodwill is reviewed for impairment using a  two-step test, annually or more frequently if events or circumstances, such as significant declines in expected  sales, earnings or cash flows, indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset might be impaired;Nothing
4663;Under the  first step, the fair value of a reporting unit, based on discounted future cash flows, is compared to its net carrying  amount;Nothing
4664;If the fair value is greater than the carrying amount, no impairment is deemed to exist and the second  step is not required to be performed;Nothing
4665;If the fair value is less than the carrying amount, the second test must be  performed whereby the implied fair value of the reporting unit?s goodwill must be estimated;Nothing
4666;The implied fair value  of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of  the reporting unit;Nothing
4667;The carrying value of goodwill in excess of its implied fair value is charged to income;Nothing
4668;We  selected the fourth quarter as our annual testing period for goodwill;Nothing
4669;191    Future cash flows are forecasted based on our best estimate of revenues, production costs, manufacturing  overhead and other costs;Nothing
4670;These estimates are made by reviewing existing contracts, expected future orders,  current cost structure, anticipated cost variations, collective agreements and general market conditions;Nothing
4671;Variable interest entities   We consolidate VIEs for which we assume a majority of the risk of losses, or for which we are entitled to receive a  majority of the residual returns (if no party is exposed to a majority of the VIE?s losses), or both (the primary  beneficiary);Nothing
4672;Upon consolidation, the primary beneficiary generally must initially record all of the VIE?s assets,  liabilities and non-controlling interests at fair value at the date the variable interest holder became the primary  beneficiary;Nothing
4673;See Note 26 ? Variable interest entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional  information on VIEs;Nothing
4674;We revise our initial determination of the accounting for VIEs when certain events occur,  such as changes in related governing documents or contractual arrangements;Nothing
4675;We use a variety of complex estimation processes involving both qualitative and quantitative factors to determine  whether an entity is a VIE, and to analyze and calculate our expected losses and our expected residual returns;Nothing
4676;These processes involve estimating the future cash flows and performance of the VIE, analyzing the variability in  those cash flows from expected cash flows, and allocating the expected losses and expected returns among the  identified parties holding variable interests to then determine who is the primary beneficiary;Nothing
4677;In addition, there is a  significant amount of judgment exercised in applying these consolidation rules to our transactions;Nothing
4678;Variable interest includes credit and residual value guarantees to certain SPEs created solely to purchase  commercial aircraft, subordinated debt, and equity investments related to partnership arrangements entered into  to provide manufactured rail equipment, civil engineering work and related long-term services;Nothing
4679;Product warranties   We issue warranties for products sold related to systems, accessories, equipment, parts and software that we  develop;Nothing
4680;A provision for warranty cost is recorded when revenue for the underlying product is recognized;Nothing
4681;The  cost is estimated based on a number of factors, including historical warranty claims and cost experience, the type  and duration of warranty coverage, the nature of the products sold and the counter-warranty coverage available  from our suppliers;Nothing
4682;We review our product warranty provisions quarterly, and any adjustment is recognized to income;Nothing
4683;Warranty  expense is recorded as a component of cost of sales;Nothing
4684;Employee future benefits    Pension and other employee benefit costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating  such amounts;Nothing
4685;The discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the rate of  compensation increase are important elements of cost and obligation measurement;Nothing
4686;Other assumptions include  the inflation rate and the health-care cost trend rate, as well as demographic factors such as retirement, mortality  and turnover rates;Nothing
4687;All assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis;Nothing
4688;The discount rate is used to determine the present value of the estimated future benefit payments on the  measurement date;Nothing
4689;We have little discretion in selecting the discount rate, as it must represent the market rates  for high-quality fixed-income investments available for the period to maturity of the benefits;Nothing
4690;A lower discount rate  increases the benefit obligation and generally increases benefit cost;Nothing
4691;The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined considering historical returns, future estimates  of long-term investment returns and asset allocations;Nothing
4692;A lower expected return assumption increases benefit cost;Nothing
4693;The rate of compensation increase is determined considering current salary structure, historical wage increases  and anticipated wage increases;Nothing
4694;Sensitivity analyses are presented in the Pension section in Overview;Nothing
4695;192    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    In compliance with the Canadian Securities Administrators? National Instrument 52-109, we have filed certificates  signed by the Chief Executive Officer (?CEO?) and the Chief Financial Officer (?CFO?) that, among other things,  report on the design and effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and the design and effectiveness of  internal controls over financial reporting;Nothing
4696;"Disclosure controls and procedures   The CEO and the CFO have designed disclosure controls and procedures, or have caused them to be designed  under their supervision, in order to provide reasonable assurance that:  ? material information relating to the Corporation has been made known to them; and  ? information required to be disclosed in the Corporation?s filings is recorded, processed, summarized and   reported within the time periods specified in securities legislation";Nothing
4697;An evaluation was carried out, under the supervision of the CEO and the CFO, of the design and effectiveness of  our disclosure controls and procedures;Nothing
4698;Based on this evaluation, the CEO and the CFO concluded that the  disclosure controls and procedures are effective;Nothing
4699;Internal controls over financial reporting   The CEO and the CFO have also designed internal controls over financial reporting, or have caused them to be  designed under their supervision, in order to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial  reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with Canadian GAAP;Nothing
4700;An evaluation was carried out, under the supervision of the CEO and the CFO, of the design and effectiveness of  our internal controls over financial reporting;Nothing
4701;Based on this evaluation, the CEO and the CFO concluded that the  internal controls over financial reporting are effective, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) on Internal Control ? Integrated Framework;Nothing
4702;Changes in internal controls over financial reporting    No changes were made to our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter and fiscal  year ended January 31, 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our  internal controls over financial reporting;Nothing
4703;193    FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES    We are subject to currency fluctuations from the translation of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities of our  self-sustaining foreign operations using a functional currency other than the U;Nothing

7490;"The Corporation and its subsidiaries carry out their operations in two distinct segments, the  aerospace segment (BA) and the transportation segment (BT), each one characterized by a specific operating  cycle; therefore, the consolidated balance sheets are unclassified";Nothing
7491;Changes in accounting policies  Business combinations, consolidated financial statements and non-controlling interests In January 2009, the AcSB released Section 1582 ?Business combinations?, Section 1601 ?Consolidated financial  statements? and Section 1602 ?Non-controlling interests?, which replace Section 1581 ?Business combinations?  and Section 1600 ?Consolidated financial statements?;Nothing
7492;"Section 1582 provides the Canadian equivalent to IFRS 3 ""Business Combinations""";Nothing
7493;The new recommendations  require measuring business acquisitions at the fair value of the acquired business, including the measurement at  fair value of items such as non-controlling interests and contingent payment considerations;Nothing
7494;Also, the previously  unrecognized deferred tax assets related to the acquiree subsequent to the business combination are recognized  in the consolidated statements of income rather than as a reduction in goodwill;Nothing
7495;In addition, business acquisition  related costs are expensed as incurred;Nothing
7496;The adoption of Section 1582 should have a material effect on the accounting for business combinations that  occur subsequent to February 1, 2009;Nothing
7497;Past acquisitions are not restated;Nothing
7498;Section 1601, together with Section 1602, replaces Section 1600;Nothing
7499;Section 1601 establishes standards for the  preparation of consolidated financial statements and is aligned with the corresponding provisions of Section 1600;Nothing
7500;Section 1602 is aligned with the corresponding provisions of IAS 27, ?Consolidated and Separate Financial  Statements? and establishes standards for accounting for non-controlling interests in a subsidiary subsequent to a  business combination;Nothing
7501;"Section 1602 introduces a number of changes, for example:   ? in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of shareholders? equity, non-controlling  interests are now presented as a separate component of shareholders? equity rather than as a liability;    ? non-controlling interests are no longer recorded as a deduction of net income and total comprehensive  income as a result of their presentation in equity;   ? for the purpose of computing EPS, net income is attributed between the shareholders of Bombardier Inc";Nothing
7502;and the non-controlling interests based on their respective economic interests;Nothing
7503;"The components of OCI  are attributed following the same logic; and   ? changes in non-controlling ownership interests not resulting in a loss of control are accounted for as  equity transactions, with no gains and losses recorded in the consolidated statements of income";Nothing
7504;The Corporation has elected to early adopt these sections, effective February 1, 2009, in order to more closely  align itself with IFRS and mitigate the impact of adopting IFRS at the changeover date;Nothing
7505;In accordance with the  transitional provisions, these sections have been applied prospectively, except for the presentation requirements  for non-controlling interests, which must be applied retrospectively;Nothing
7506;The adoption of these sections did not have a  significant impact on the Corporation?s consolidated financial statements but gave rise to the above-mentioned  reclassifications of non-controlling interests;Nothing
7507;F-11    Future changes in accounting policies   IFRS In February 2008, the AcSB confirmed that Canadian GAAP for publicly accountable entities will be changed to  IFRS effective in calendar year 2011;Nothing

7529;To the extent that significant unusual  transactions or events occur during the one-month lag period, the Corporation?s Consolidated Financial  Statements are adjusted accordingly;Nothing
7530;VIEs ? AcG-15 ?Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities? (?AcG-15?) requires the consolidation of VIEs if a party  with an ownership, contractual or other financial interest in the VIE (a variable interest holder) is exposed to a  majority of the risk of loss from the VIE?s activities, is entitled to receive a majority of the VIE?s residual returns (if  no party is exposed to a majority of the VIE?s losses), or both (the primary beneficiary);Nothing
7531;Upon consolidation, the  primary beneficiary must initially record all of the VIE?s assets, liabilities and non-controlling interests at fair value  at the date the variable interest holder becomes the primary beneficiary;Nothing
7532;See Note 26 ? Variable interest entities,  for additional information on VIEs;Nothing
7533;The Corporation revises its determination of the accounting for VIEs when  certain events occur, such as changes in governing documents or contractual arrangements;Nothing
7534;Use of estimates   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Canadian GAAP requires management to make  estimates and assumptions, particularly as they relate to long-term contracts, fair value measurement of financial  instruments, provision for credit and residual value guarantees related to the sales of aircraft, revenue recognition  for medium and large business aircraft, valuation of pre-owned aircraft, actuarial and economic assumptions used  in determining employee future benefits, useful lives of long-lived assets, recovery of goodwill, VIEs, accrual of  product warranties and income taxes;Nothing
7535;Management?s best estimates are based on the facts and circumstances  available at the time estimates are made, historical experience, general economic conditions and trends, and  management assessment of probable future outcomes of these matters;Nothing
7536;These estimates and assumptions affect   F-12       the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the  financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period;Nothing
7537;Actual results could  differ from these estimates, and such differences could be material;Nothing
7538;Management conducts quarterly reviews, as well as a detailed annual review of its cost estimates as part of its  annual budget process;Nothing
7539;The effect of revision on long-term contracts is accounted for by way of a cumulative  catch-up adjustment to cost of sales in the period in which the revision takes place;Nothing
